# voxel-skyhook

A block that can be placed in mid-air, no other block required in the world to be placed against (voxel.js plugin)

To use, right-click in the general direction you want to place the skyhook.
Unlike normal blocks, which are placed adjacent to the existing block you
clicked, the skyhook can be placed on nothing.

Useful for building large floating structures in the sky without having
to build temporary scaffolding.

Requires [voxel-use](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-use)

(Inspired by the [Angel Block](http://ftbwiki.org/Angel_Block) from the
Extra Utilities modification for Minecraft)
