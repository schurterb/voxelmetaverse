Load with [voxel-plugins](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-plugins)

To use in-game, acquire the `scriptblock` item
(it'll be under "blocks" with
[voxel-inventory-creative](https://github.com/voxel/voxel-inventory-creative),
or you can type `.item scriptblock` if
[voxel-commands](https://github.com/voxel/voxel-commands) is installed) and
place it in the world.

Right-click on the top of the block to change the script. By default, it will
popup an alert as shown in the screenshot, but you can run any JavaScript code
you want, including interacting the game world.

Right-click anywhere else on the block to run the script.
