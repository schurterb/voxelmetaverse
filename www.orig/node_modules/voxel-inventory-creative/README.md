# voxel-inventory-creative

Inventory dialog with an infinite supply of all items and blocks (voxel.js plugin)

![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/pgYwKbv.png "Screenshot")

Can be invoked with [voxel-gamemode](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-gamemode) by pressing
the `inventory` key while in creative mode (in survival mode,
[voxel-inventory-crafting](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-inventory-crafting) is opened
instead).

Shows items/blocks grouped by `creativeTab` property from [voxel-registry](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-registry).
If this property is missing, the item or block will be grouped into the "items" or "blocks" category, respectively.
The category buttons can be used to change the category of items displayed.

You can click to take these infinite item piles from the dialog into your
[voxel-carry](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-carry) player inventory.
