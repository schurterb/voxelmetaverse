# voxel-pickaxe

Adds pickaxe tools to help you mine faster (voxel.js plugin)

To start out, acquire wooden logs, craft into planks, craft two planks
into sticks, then craft a pickaxe as follows, in a [voxel-workbench](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-workbench):

The wooden pickaxe can now be used for mining, collecting the resources with [voxel-harvest](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-harvest) installed:

Once you have mined enough cobblestone you can craft a stone pickaxe
and mine even faster.

If your pickaxe is wearing out, you can repair it by crafting with a piece 
of the pickaxe's head material (repeat to repair further):

Requires [voxel-registry](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-registry),
and [craftingrecipes](https://github.com/deathcap/craftingrecipes) for recipe support.
Mining speed is interpreted by [voxel-mine](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-mine).
