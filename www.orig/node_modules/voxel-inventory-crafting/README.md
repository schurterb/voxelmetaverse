The lower grid is the player's inventory, from
[voxel-inventory-dialog](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-inventory-dialog)
(original name of this plugin, before 0.3.0).

The upper area is a 2x2 crafting grid to use a subset of available
[craftingrecipes](https://github.com/deathcap/craftingrecipes)
([voxel-workbench](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-workbench) allows crafting with larger recipes),
the result picked up from the (pickup-only) rightmost slot.
