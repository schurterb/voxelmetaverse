Note: this screenshot was taken with [ProgrammerArt](https://github.com/deathcap/ProgrammerArt) v2.0,
but for better textures you can use other resource packs, which voxel-wool is compatible with; for
example [Faithful32](https://github.com/smenes/Faithful32):

This plugin also serves as an example of using [voxel-registry](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-registry)
with `registerBlocks()` and dynamic block properties. The `texture` and `displayName`
properties are computed from the "block metadata" value (0-15 for each of the sixteen wool colors).
