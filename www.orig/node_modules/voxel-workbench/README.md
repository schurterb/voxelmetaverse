# voxel-workbench

Addon for voxel.js to add a workbench block to access a 3x3 crafting grid.

The workbench is crafted with four planks (the 2x2 crafting grid
shown below is from [voxel-inventory-dialog](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-inventory-dialog)):

Once crafted, the workbench item can be placed in the world:

You can then right-click to open the crafting GUI:
