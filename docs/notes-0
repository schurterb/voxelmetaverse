# Experimenting with webpack ... unfortunately

# install webpack generally
sudo npm install webpack webpack-cli --global

# build webpack dist
webpack build ./index.js
# - Need to install modules: fs path stream zlib
# npm install fs path stream zlib --save-dev

# serve webpack
npx webpack serve

## Forget all that.. Just do this for the voxelmetaverse project:
npm install beefy
npm run start
