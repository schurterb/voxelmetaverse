# goal is to have back-end chunk generator -> chunk -> Geometry -> scene.add (or scene.update?)
#  - voxel-land generates terrain via webworker
#  - webworkify removed as unnecessary
#  - voxel-engine.showChunk does meshing and chunk rendering
#  - - TODO: This needs to create a THREE.Geometry (use the latest?) and add it to a THREE.Scene
#  - -       Create a separate canvas so we can test the StackGL against the THREE during this phase
#  - -       Canvas sizing might be doable in gl-now
#
# TODO: modify chunk-generator-worker.js to load scripts instead of having them ALL embedded
#
